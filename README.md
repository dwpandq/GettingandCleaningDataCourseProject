Files

CodeBook.md - This file describes the data that was analyzed. It describes the variables created in order to best manipulate the appropriate data.

run_analysis.R - Is the code file that was used to download and manipulate the data in the fashion requested for this project, that specifically achieves the following:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
    each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

projectresults.txt - Is the results file for the manipulated and evaluated data that was requested per the instructions of this project.
